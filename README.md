# Movie and TV Show Review Blog

This is a personal review blog where I share my thoughts and opinions on the movies and TV shows I've watched. The website is designed with a clean and modern layout, featuring a responsive header, main sections, and a footer. It incorporates JavaScript and jQuery scripts to enhance user experience.

## Features

- **Header**: The header includes a logo and a navigation menu, providing easy access to different sections of the website. The menu items are styled with buttons.css, and the layout is adjusted in styles.css.

- **Main Sections**: The main content is divided into four sections:
  - **Showcase**: The showcase section welcomes visitors with an appealing image, accompanied by a captivating message. The design is created using styles.css, which adds a background image and overlays it with a gradient color.
  - **First Start**: This section provides a brief introduction to the website, featuring a two-column layout. The content is styled with base.css and icons from an imported library are utilized. The design is customized in styles.css to ensure a cohesive look.
  - **Second Box**: Here, users can find additional information about the website. The section includes an image on the left and a description on the right. A button with a hover effect is implemented using jQuery. The styling, including colors and font sizes, is defined in styles.css.
  - **Movies**: In this section, movie cards are displayed in a three-column grid layout. Each card includes a movie cover image, a summary, and a button to visit the film's website. The buttons are styled with button.css, and the card layout is adjusted in styles.css to create an engaging user experience.

- **Footer**: The footer contains links to standard pages and social media profiles. The links are organized in two columns using a container and row structure. The styling for the links and social media icons is defined in styles.css.
